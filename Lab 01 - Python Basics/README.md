# **Lab 01: Python Fundamentals**

## **Overview**
In this lab, we'll dive into the core building blocks of Python programming. We'll start with **Python basics**, including variables, data types, and operators. Next, we'll explore **control structures**, such as conditional statements (`if-else`) and loops (`for`, `while`).

We'll also cover essential data structures like **Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries, and Arrays**, along with hands-on assignments to reinforce these concepts. Additionally, we'll introduce **functions**, including built-in functions, user-defined functions, and advanced concepts like **lambda functions, map, and filter functions**.

By the end of this lab, you'll have a strong foundation in Python fundamentals, enabling you to write clean and efficient code. ðŸš€
