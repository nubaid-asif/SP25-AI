# **Lab 02: Python Advanced**

## **Overview**
In this lab, we will explore advanced Python concepts that are essential for building scalable and efficient applications. We'll begin with **Python imports**, covering modules, packages, and the standard library. Then, we'll move on to **file handling**, learning how to read, write, and manage files effectively.

We'll also cover **exception handling**, including the use of `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to ensure robust error handling. Additionally, we'll dive deep into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Advanced topics like **magic methods, operator overloading, and custom exceptions** will also be explored.

By the end of this lab, you'll have a strong understanding of Python's advanced capabilities and be able to write well-structured, maintainable, and efficient code. ðŸš€
